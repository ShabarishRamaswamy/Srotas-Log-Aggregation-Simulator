# Srotas-Log-Aggregation
Log Generator for Srotas

# Motivation
I wanted to make an app which will generate random logs which can be used by the Srotas project.
This is also an interesting point to explore other similar fields such as **Stochastic processes**, 
**Queueing theory**, **Discrete Event Simulation** and **Fuzzing**.
